Methods for Adding CSS

Overview

In this exercise, I practiced applying CSS to an HTML file using three different methods: external CSS, internal CSS, and inline CSS. The goal of this exercise was to understand the differences between these methods and use them to style an HTML document.

What I Learned

External CSS: I created a separate CSS file and linked it to the HTML file. This method is useful for applying styles across multiple pages.
Internal CSS: I added styles within the <style> tags in the <head> section of the HTML file. This method is useful when you need to apply styles to a single page.
Inline CSS: I applied styles directly within HTML tags using the style attribute. This method is typically used for small, specific changes.
Implementation

For this exercise:

I used type selectors for the external and internal CSS methods.
I created and linked the necessary CSS file manually to the HTML file.
I practiced using the proper syntax for each method and ensured they worked together to style three specific elements: div, p, and button.
